This directory contains examples of how to call each endpoint of the
PdfRest API using cURL. Please refer to https://pdfrest.com/documentation.html
for accepted inputs, options, and other specifics about individual endpoints.

Note that these samples use the jq processor (https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) in
order to parse the IDs of uploaded files and pretty-print the final output
JSON.
